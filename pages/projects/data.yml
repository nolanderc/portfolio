    - title: Matjakt
      description: 
        - Search for the cheapest foodstuffs in stores all around Sweden. 
        - Compare millions of prices across 250+ stores to find the best deals
          and save money. Prices are automatically fetched from some of the
          largest food-retailers in Sweden (currently Ica and Hemk√∂p).
        - "Behind the scenes you will find all kinds of wonders: <ul>
           <li>a fast search algorithm that corrects for spelling errors</li>
           <li>high performance asynchronous servers</li>
           <li>efficient image recognition algorithms</li>
           <li>and much more...</li></ul>"

    - title: Real-Time Voxel Ray Tracing
      description: 
        - Display ray traced voxel environments in real-time.
        - Complex voxel environments can be dynamically loaded onto a GPU and
          be ray-traced in real-time thanks to an efficient Octree traversal
          algorithm of my design.
        - There's currently support for voxels of differing colors, shadows and
          more!

    - title: rust-postgres-query
      description: 
        - Statically typed SQL queries with readable parameter names.  
        - An open source Rust library where the user defines named parameters and names
          which are encoded into an SQL-query at compile-time.
